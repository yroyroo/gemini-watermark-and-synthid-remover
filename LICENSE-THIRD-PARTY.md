# Third-Party Licenses — `wmr` release binaries

Every `wmr` release binary is a self-contained package that ships the FDnCNN AI
denoise (NCNN + volk, an embedded model) and — as of v1.9.0 — MI-GAN inpaint
(ONNX Runtime + a bundled model; replaces the earlier FSR/LaMa). NCNN, volk,
FDnCNN, OpenCV (incl. the opencv_contrib `xphoto` module, still linked though FSR
is now removed — pending a cleanup), and ONNX Runtime are linked into the
package; their licenses are reproduced below so they travel with every download.

The macOS arm64 package additionally bundles the Vulkan loader (`libvulkan`),
MoltenVK (`libMoltenVK`), the ONNX Runtime shared lib (`libonnxruntime`), and the
MI-GAN model next to the binary. The Linux and Windows packages likewise co-locate
`libonnxruntime.so.1` / `onnxruntime.dll` and the MI-GAN model. The macOS Intel
build is MI-GAN-free (no osx-x86_64 ONNX Runtime build exists); it falls back to
NS for NotebookLM. MoltenVK ships its own license inside its dylib.

## Model conversion credit

The FDnCNN model was converted to the NCNN format used here by
[allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool](https://github.com/allenk/GeminiWatermarkTool)
(MIT). The committed NCNN model headers (`assets/model_core.{mem.h,id.h}`)
were captured from a one-time build of that project, which runs `ncnn2mem` to
emit the embedded `.mem.h`/`.id.h` headers from the FDnCNN `.param`/`.bin`.
The model weights are upstream's converted bytes; no re-conversion was
performed for this project.

## ONNX Runtime — MIT License

The `wmr` binary loads ONNX Runtime (the official prebuilt v1.27.1 shared
library, fetched at CMake configure time) to run the LaMa inpainter. ONNX

## MI-GAN inpaint model — MIT License

Source: <https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/MI-GAN> · ONNX: <https://huggingface.co/andraniksargsyan/migan>

`wmr` ships `assets/migan_pipeline_v2.onnx` — the MI-GAN ("A Simple Baseline for
Image Inpainting on Mobile Devices", ICCV 2023, Picsart AI Research) model,
co-located with every MI-GAN-enabled release binary (macOS arm64, Linux,
Windows). It is the default NotebookLM intricate-scene inpainter (replaces the
earlier FSR/LaMa).

MI-GAN's **code and weights** are licensed under the **MIT License** — clean for
redistribution (unlike the LaMa weights it replaces, which were Places2-pretrained
under a gray-area license).
